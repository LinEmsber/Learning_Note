What is Starvation?

From the dictionary of medical science, starvation is a result of severe or total lack of nutrients
that are needed for the maintenance of life. Similarly, in computer science, starvation is a problem
that is encountered when multiple threads or processes wait for the same resource, which is called a
deadlock.

Starvation occurs when one or more threads in your program are blocked from gaining access to a
resource and, as a result, cannot make progress.

In order to get out from a deadlock, one of the processes or threads should have to give up or roll
back so that the other thread or process can use the resource. If this continuously happens and the
same process or thread have to give up or roll back each time while letting other processes or threads
to use the resource, then the selected process or thread, which rolled back will undergo a situation
called starvation. Therefore, in order to get out from a deadlock, starvation is one of the solutions.
Therefore, sometimes starvation is called a kind of a livelock. When there are many high priority
processes or threads, a lower priority process or thread will always starve in a deadlock.


What is Deadlock?

A deadlock is a condition that occurs when two threads or processes wait for each other to complete
the task. They will only hang up but never stop or finish their task. In computer science, deadlocks
can be seen everywhere.

Deadlock is one of the main problems in multiprocessing systems and parallel computing. As a solution,
a locking system called process synchronization is implemented for software as well as hardware.
