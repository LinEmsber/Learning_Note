===============================================================================

A virtual file system (VFS) or virtual filesystem switch is an abstraction layer on top of a more
concrete file system. The purpose of a VFS is to allow client applications to access different
types of concrete file systems in a uniform way. A VFS can, for example, be used to access local
and network storage devices transparently without the client application noticing the difference.
It can be used to bridge the differences in Windows, Mac OS and Unix filesystems, so that
applications can access files on local file systems of those types without having to know what
type of file system they are accessing.


A VFS specifies an interface (or a "contract") between the kernel and a concrete file system.
Therefore, it is easy to add support for new file system types to the kernel simply by fulfilling
the contract. The terms of the contract might change incompatibly from release to release, which
would require that concrete file system support be recompiled, and possibly modified before
recompilation, to allow it to work with a new release of the operating system; or the supplier
of the operating system might make only backward-compatible changes to the contract, so that
concrete file system support built for a given release of the operating system would work
with future versions of the operating system.
