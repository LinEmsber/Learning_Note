===============================================================================

In computing, a context switch is the process of storing and restoring the state of a process or
thread so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time. This enables multiple
processes to share a single CPU and is an essential feature of a multitasking operating system.


The precise meaning of "context switch" varies significantly in usage, most often to mean "thread
switch or process switch" or "process switch only", either of which may be referred to as a "task
switch". More finely, one can distinguish thread switch (switching between two threads within a
given process), process switch (switching between two processes), mode switch (domain crossing:
switching between user mode and kernel mode within a given thread), register switch, a stack frame
switch, and address space switch (memory map switch: changing virtual memory to physical memory map).

The computational cost of context switches varies significantly depending on what precisely it entails,
from little more than a subroutine call for light-weight user processes, to very expensive, though
typically much less than that of saving or restoring a process image.
