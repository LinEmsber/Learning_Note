				vmlinuz
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A kernel is a program that constitutes the central core of a computer operating system. It is the first thing
that is loaded into memory when a computer is booted up (i.e., started), and it remains in memory for the entire time
that the computer is in operation.

vmlinuz is the name of the Linux kernel executable.
vmlinuz is a compressed Linux kernel, and it is bootable.

vmlinuz should not be confused with vmlinux, which is the kernel in a non-compressed and non-bootable form. vmlinux is
generally just an intermediate step to producing vmlinuz.

vmlinuz is located in the /boot directory, which is the directory that contains the files needed to begin booting the
system. The file named vmlinuz might be the actual kernel executable itself, which might bear a name such as
/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-19.8.0


The Linux kernel is compiled by issuing the following command:

> make bzImage

This results in the creation of a file named bzImage in a directory such as /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/linux/boot/.

bzImage is then copied using the copy command to the /boot directory and simultaneously renamed vmlinuz.

> cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/linux/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz

vmlinuz is not merely a compressed image. It also has gzip decompressor code built into it.

Both zImage and bzImage are compressed with gzip. The difference is that zImage decompresses into low memory , and
bzImage decompresses into high memory (more than 1MB).

Virtual memory is the use of space on a hard disk drive (HDD) to simulate additional RAM (random access memory)
capacity.
