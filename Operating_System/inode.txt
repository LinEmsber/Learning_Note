===============================================================================

In a Unix-style file system, the inode is a data structure used to represent a filesystem object,
which can be one of various things including a file or a directory. Each inode stores the attributes
and disk block location(s) of the filesystem object's data. Filesystem object attributes may
include manipulation metadata (e.g. change, access, modify time), as well as owner and permission
data (e.g. group-id, user-id, permissions).

Directories are lists of names assigned to inodes. The directory contains an entry for itself,
its parent, and each of its children.

Details:
A file system relies on data structures about the files, beside the file content. The former is called
metadataâ€”data that describes data. Each file is associated with an inode, which is identified by an
integer number, often referred to as an i-number or inode number.
