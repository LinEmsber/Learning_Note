===============================================================================

In computing, virtual memory is a memory management technique that is implemented using both
hardware and software. It maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual addresses,
into physical addresses in computer memory. Main storage as seen by a process or task appears
 as a contiguous address space or collection of contiguous segments.

The operating system manages virtual address spaces and the assignment of real memory to
virtual memory. Address translation hardware in the CPU, often referred to as a memory management
unit (MMU), automatically translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Software within
the operating system may extend these capabilities to provide a virtual address space that can
exceed the capacity of real memory and thus reference more memory than is physically present in
the computer.

The primary benefits of virtual memory include freeing applications from having to manage a shared
memory space, increased security due to memory isolation, and being able to conceptually use more
memory than might be physically available, using the technique of paging.
