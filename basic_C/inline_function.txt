                        inline function
===============================================================================

In the C and C++ programming languages, an inline function is one qualified with the keyword inline;
this serves two purposes. Firstly, it serves as a compiler directive that suggests (but does not
require) that the compiler substitute the body of the function inline by performing inline expansion,
i.e. by inserting the function code at the address of each function call, thereby saving the overhead
of a function call.

The second purpose of inline is to change linkage behavior; the details of this are complicated.
This is necessary due to the C/C++ separate compilation + linkage model, specifically because the
definition (body) of the function must be duplicated in all translation units where it is used, to
allow inlining during compiling, which, if the function has external linkage, causes a collision
during linking (it violates uniqueness of external symbols; in C++, the One Definition Rule).

An inline function can be written in C or C++ like this:

        inline void swap(int *m, int *n)
        {
                int temp = *m;
                *m = *n;
                *n = temp;
        }

Then, a statement such as the following:

        swap(&x, &y);

will be translated into:

        int temp = x;
        x = y;
        y = temp;

When implementing a sorting algorithm doing lots of swaps, this can increase the execution speed.


Why declare a C function as static inline?

It encourages the compiler to build the function into the code where it is used (generally with the
goal of improving execution speed).

static inline is usually used with small functions that are better done in the calling routine than
by using a call mechanism, simply because they are so short and fast that actually doing them is
better than calling a separate copy.
